> **NOTICE:** This project is currently in ALPHA. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and significant changes between versions.

placeholderOS is a custom operating system designed for [CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc), the popular Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers to the game. This project aims to provide a kernel for the OS.

## About

placeholderOS-kernel is being developed by **APT SHOW INCORPORATED** as an experimental platform for exploring security concepts and user management within ComputerCraft. The kernel manages the core functionality of the OS, including:

- **Multi-user Authentication**: Secure user accounts with permission levels
- **Permission Groups**: Tiered access system (guest, user, admin, trusted, system)
- **Command Shell Interface**: Built in streamlined command processing
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for easy extension

## Current State

As this project is in ALPHA, many features are still under active development. The core login system and permission structure are functional, but expect ongoing changes to the API and feature set.
